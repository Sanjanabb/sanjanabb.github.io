        <h2 id="FP">First post</h2>
        
        <p>
         I find <em class="tib">website designing, developing, testing, and maintaining</em> is one of the skills that every entrepreneur needs to possess. I am an aspiring entrepreneur. 
         </p>
         
         
         <h2 id="MI">My Inspiration</h2>
        <p> 
        
         My driving force to learn programming is <strong>to design a website for a cause</strong>. This motivates me to come back from my routine work and continue with programming where I left it. These days whatever the work I take up in my routine, I am trying to write a program to that task or trying if I can do that task using code. <em>This inquisitive nature is helping me to make time for coding.</em>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="PJ">Start of Programming Journey</h2>
        
        
        <p>My <em>curiosity</em> to learn programming pushed me to collect the information on how to start with programming. I watched many youtube videos and consumed so much information on them. But I still was not sure what the best approach for a beginner is. Finally, I happened to <strong>visit a youtube channel called Codebasics</strong>. I admire the YouTuber who was very clear in his mind on <em>how to guide anybody</em> who wants to start with programming.</p>
        <h3>Roadmap to Learn Programming</h3>
        
        
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/TechTopics/CodingRoadmap2020/learn_coding_roadmap_2020.md">Programming Roadmap</a></p>
        
        <h2 id="MP">My Practice</h2>
        <p>
To start with something new, there should be a clear <strong>roadmap</strong> to get the required and authentic study material. This subconsciously satisfies learners that they are going on the right path with the suitable study material. The channel offered a website that <em>mentions the steps to be followed</em> to learn to program. This is how I happened to come across the <strong>Khan Academy</strong>. <br><em>I commend khan academy for providing a free tutorial to learn HTML and CSS programming</em> for those who cannot afford to buy one. The <em>quality and the flow of teaching</em> are so designed that even a beginner feels accomplished by doing the challenges designed at the end of every lecture.</p>
